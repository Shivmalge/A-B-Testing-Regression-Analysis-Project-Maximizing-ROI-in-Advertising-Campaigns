# üìä Ad Campaign Effectiveness Analysis: Facebook vs. AdWords

## üåü Project Summary
This project investigates and compares the performance of Facebook and AdWords advertising platforms throughout 2019. The objective is to identify the platform that delivers superior results in terms of clicks, conversions, and cost-efficiency‚Äîultimately helping to improve ROI and drive smarter marketing decisions.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
As a data-driven marketing agency, improving the return on investment (ROI) for advertising campaigns is a key priority. By analyzing campaign data from both Facebook and AdWords, the goal was to pinpoint the better-performing platform and optimize future ad spending accordingly.
#### Key Question:
‚û°Ô∏è Which advertising platform delivers higher conversions, better engagement, and improved cost-efficiency?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statistical Testing: SciPy, Statsmodels
- Predictive Modeling: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Additional Analysis: Cointegration testing, warnings management

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview
The dataset captures daily advertising performance metrics for the year 2019, comprising 365 records for both Facebook and AdWords campaigns. Key fields include:

- Date: The date of the campaign run.
- Ad Views: Number of times the ad was displayed.
- Ad Clicks: Number of user clicks on the ad.
- Ad Conversions: Number of completed actions (conversions) from the ad.
- Cost per Ad: Campaign cost for the day.
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): Clicks as a percentage of views.
- Conversion Rate: Conversions as a percentage of clicks.
- Cost per Click (CPC): Average cost per user click.

## üîç Methodology & Process
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Parsed the Date column into datetime objects for time-series analysis.
- Cleaned and converted financial and percentage columns into numeric values.
- Verified data types for smooth computation and analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend Analysis: Visualized distributions of clicks and conversions using histograms. Facebook consistently showed higher conversion rates.

### 3. Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- Hypothesis: Facebook ads lead to significantly more conversions than AdWords.
- Conducted an independent T-test:
    - Facebook mean conversions: 11.74
    - AdWords mean conversions: 5.98
    - T-statistic: 32.88, p-value: 9.35e-134

- Result: Strong evidence supports the alternative hypothesis‚ÄîFacebook outperforms AdWords in conversions.

### 4. Regression Analysis
- Built a Linear Regression model predicting Facebook conversions based on ad clicks.
- Model Results:
  - R¬≤ Score: 76.35%
  - Low mean squared error (MSE), suggesting a strong fit.
- Example Predictions:
  - 50 clicks ‚Üí ~10 conversions
  - 80 clicks ‚Üí ~16 conversions
